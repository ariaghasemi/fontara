# Testing

FontARA has four practical test layers: unit, inject, browser, and extension
package lint.

## Unit Tests

```sh
pnpm test
```

Unit tests cover pure logic and source contracts:

- Storage normalization and sync chunking.
- Site matching and site profile resolution.
- Config and site CSS hygiene.
- Runtime messaging contracts.
- Manifest and build contracts.
- UI source expectations.
- CI workflow expectations.

Focused unit run:

```sh
node --import tsx --test tests/unit/site-matching.test.ts
```

## Inject Tests

```sh
pnpm test:inject
```

Inject tests run content script behavior in a Node-powered DOM environment. They
cover:

- Font application without reload.
- Mutation observer scheduling.
- Code, icon, aria-hidden, inline font, and contenteditable protection.
- Runtime command routing.
- Performance guardrails around read/write separation.

## Browser Tests

Chrome:

```sh
pnpm test:browser:chrome
```

Firefox:

```sh
FONTARA_FIREFOX_BROWSER_TESTS=1 FONTARA_FIREFOX_HEADLESS=1 pnpm test:browser:firefox
```

Browser tests build dedicated test extensions, install them in real browsers,
drive popup and options UI, open fixture pages, and verify page styles without
reloads.

Use desktop Chrome 130 or newer and Firefox 140 ESR or newer. Set `CHROME_PATH` or
`FIREFOX_PATH` to select a specific installed binary; an old cached browser below
the manifest minimum cannot load the extension.

Firefox for Android requires version 142 or newer to install. The current
matrix runs desktop browsers and does not include Android device validation.

The Chrome suite covers:

- Global and current-site activation.
- Popup include/exclude and font selection.
- Options site profiles.
- Backup export/import/reset.
- Sync storage stress payloads.
- Viewport coverage for extension pages.
- Axe WCAG A/AA checks for popup and options in en/fa/ar on mobile and desktop.
- Keyboard navigation and mobile navigation closure.
- Shadow DOM, same-origin iframes, cross-origin iframes, SPA navigation, lazy
  DOM, virtualized lists, adoptedStyleSheets, CSS variables, and editable text.

The Firefox suite covers the stabilized cross-browser runtime path and hard
fixture behavior.

### Targeted browser regressions

`pnpm test:browser:chrome` includes the main extension suite, accessibility
checks, and these focused suites:

| Suite | Behavior covered |
| --- | --- |
| [background-regressions.test.mjs](../tests/browser/background-regressions.test.mjs) | An already-open options page still receives changes after a service-worker restart. |
| [ui-regressions.test.mjs](../tests/browser/ui-regressions.test.mjs) | Saved system-font profiles, draft preservation, Dialog/Drawer previews, and concurrent profile changes during Google font preparation. |
| [injection-regressions.test.mjs](../tests/browser/injection-regressions.test.mjs) | Protected text-stroke subtrees, reused/nested RTL messages, bounded work queues, cancellation, and replaced document bodies. |

Run one suite against a fresh test build:

```sh
pnpm build:test:chrome
node --test --test-concurrency=1 --test-timeout=120000 tests/browser/ui-regressions.test.mjs
```

The public website and privacy page have a separate axe A/AA check on mobile
and desktop:

```sh
pnpm test:browser:site
```

### Local licensed font packages

Keep proprietary font packages outside version control. To audit every
TTF/OTF/WOFF/WOFF2 file in a local package, grouped by directory and format:

```sh
pnpm audit:font-family -- /path/to/font-package
```

Then validate the real Options upload flow, native `FontFace` loading, and the
Regular/Bold selection discovered in each nested directory and format. The
test also confirms that the same file cannot fill both slots:

```sh
FONTARA_LOCAL_FONT_FAMILY_DIR=/path/to/family pnpm test:browser:local-font-family
FONTARA_LOCAL_FONT_FAMILY_DIR=/path/to/family FONTARA_FIREFOX_BROWSER_TESTS=1 FONTARA_FIREFOX_HEADLESS=1 pnpm test:browser:local-font-family:firefox
```

The browser import test expects the package root itself to contain files whose
names include `Regular` and `Bold`. Nested directories are validated as
independent Regular/Bold selections grouped by file format. Internal OpenType
family names do not have to match because the user-provided display name and
the selected slot are authoritative.

Production package smoke tests install the unpacked release contents, open
popup/options, reject test-bridge markers, and monitor page/console errors:

```sh
pnpm test:browser:production:chrome
FONTARA_FIREFOX_BROWSER_TESTS=1 FONTARA_FIREFOX_HEADLESS=1 pnpm test:browser:production:firefox
```

## Browser Matrix in CI

Both [CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) and
[Release](../.github/workflows/release.yml) call
[verify.yml](../.github/workflows/verify.yml). It runs `pnpm verify`, preserves
the production ZIPs, and requires browser jobs for:

- Chrome stable and Chrome 130 (`130.0.6723.116`).
- Firefox stable and Firefox 140 ESR (`140.0esr`).

Each job runs its runtime suite and smoke-tests the downloaded production
artifact without rebuilding that artifact. Chrome jobs also run the public-site
accessibility check. Tagged releases publish the same preserved ZIPs after all
verification jobs succeed.

[browser-tests.yml](../.github/workflows/browser-tests.yml) adds manual and
nightly coverage across:

- Chrome stable
- Chrome beta
- Firefox latest
- Firefox beta
- Firefox ESR

The nightly channel matrix supplements the stable/minimum checks required by
normal CI and releases.

## Package Lint

```sh
pnpm lint:extension
```

This builds the Firefox release package and runs `web-ext lint` against
`build/firefox-mv3-prod`.

## Full Local Verification

```sh
pnpm verify
```

`pnpm verify` runs:

1. `pnpm check`
2. `pnpm test:coverage`
3. `pnpm build:all`
4. `pnpm lint:extension`
5. Version consistency and production/full dependency audits.
6. Reproducible ZIP checks for every target and the Firefox source archive.

Use this before release or after broad runtime/build changes. `pnpm verify`
does not run real browsers locally; run the browser suites above as well. The
reusable verification workflow combines both layers.

## Choosing the Right Test

| Change | Minimum useful verification |
| --- | --- |
| Docs only | Read rendered Markdown; run docs unit test if docs structure changed. |
| Site config | `pnpm check` and focused site matching tests. |
| Site CSS | `pnpm check` and manual/browser check on the affected site. |
| Inject runtime | `pnpm check` and `pnpm test:browser:chrome`. |
| Firefox behavior | Firefox browser test lane. |
| Build/release | `pnpm verify`, browser runtime suites, and production artifact smoke tests on stable/minimum versions. |

## Browser Test Helpers

Style assertions should use the shared DSL in
`tests/support/browser/extension-harness.mjs`:

- `expectPageStyles()`
- `createBasicPageStyleExpectation()`
- `createHardFixtureStyleExpectation()`

Prefer these helpers over one-off selector polling so font family, text stroke,
inline cleanup, Shadow DOM, iframe, and reload checks stay consistent.

Before activating a control twice, wait for its visible checked/selected state
to reflect the first action. A storage write or content-script style update
does not guarantee that the popup has rendered the corresponding state yet.
